Hello

Welcome to my SQL ISP project in PostgreSQL, consisting of querying data in postgreSQL and then visualising the data within Tableau

I hope you enjoy.



Here is how I have set up my PostgreSQL schema:

I have created 5 tables that connect. These being: customers, order_items, orders, payments and products. 

These are under the schema ‘Portfolio’

To Create this schema first open the pgAdmin project.sql file in PostgreSQL and connect to the default PostgreSQL server, then open the query tool.

You can then right click the postgres database then Create > Schema.

Once this is all set up, all the individual queries can be highlighted and then executed using the Execute query button.

Once the create table queries are executed, the data can be added by right clicking each table and selecting ‘Import/export data’ and importing each corresponding CSV file.

I hope this helps and I hope to expand on this project and create many more soon.
